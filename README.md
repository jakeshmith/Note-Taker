# Note Taker App
by Jake Smith

## App Description
This app was designed to take and store notes that a user inputs. Once notes are entered, a user can also view previously-saved notes and delete them if they need to.
It utilizes express.js, as well as html and api routes to connect a front-end to a back-end, creating a fullstack application. It was then launched through Heroku.
